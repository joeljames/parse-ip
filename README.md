## Python implementation of parsing and summarizing ip address from nginx access log file

1. Running the python script pointing to a local nginx access file
    ```
    python3 parse_ip.py {path to log file}
    ```

2. Running the python script pointing to a file accessable by http
    ```
    python3 parse_ip.py {url to access the file}
    ```
